schema is a [Go](https://golang.org) package providing access to database schema metadata, for database/sql drivers.

TODO more docs

Currently supporting the following database engines / SQL dialects:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- MySQL
- Oracle
- Postgres
- Snowflake
- SQLite
- Vitess

For a list of supported drivers, and their capabilities with regards to sql.ColumnType support, see [drivercaps](https://github.com/jimsmart/drivercaps)

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/jimsmart/schema
```

```go
import "github.com/jimsmart/schema"
```

### Dependencies

- A [supported](https://github.com/jimsmart/drivercaps) database driver.
- Standard library.
- [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) are used in the tests.
- Tests also require [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to be installed.

## Example

See GoDocs for usage examples.

## Documentation

GoDocs [https://godoc.org/github.com/jimsmart/schema](https://godoc.org/github.com/jimsmart/schema)

## Testing

Database services for testing against are hosted in Docker.

To bring up the database services: execute `docker-compose up` inside the project folder, and wait until all of the Docker services have completed their startup (i.e. there is no further output in the terminal), then open a second terminal. (In future one may choose to use `docker-compose up -d` instead)

To run the tests execute `go test` inside the project folder.

For a full coverage report, try:

```bash
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

To shutdown the Docker services, execute `docker-compose down -v` inside the project folder.

### Oracle Setup Checklist

#### Build Docker Image

Build a Docker image for Oracle, by executing script:

```bash
./build_oracle_docker_image.sh
```

Once the script has successfully completed, you are free to delete the folder used when creating the image:

```bash
rm -rf ./test/docker-oracle
```

#### Increase Docker's RAM limits

By default, Docker allocates 2gb RAM to each container. To prevent out-of-memory errors when running Oracle, increase Docker's RAM limits:

Docker -> Preferences -> Resources -> Advanced -> Memory, change to 4gb, click Apply & Restart.

#### Install Oracle Instant Client

Oracle database/sql drivers require dynamic libraries that are part of the [Oracle Instant Client](https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/technologies/instant-client.html) installation.

##### Mac

```bash
brew tap InstantClientTap/instantclient
brew install instantclient-basic
```
